     * Question 1: Bracketed Tax Engine
     * Imagine an income tax rate schedule defined by the following rules:
     * - The first $10,000 is not taxed
     * - The portion over $10,000 but not over $20,000 is taxed at 10%
     * - The portion over $20,000 but not over $50,000 is taxed at 20%
     * - The portion over $50k is taxed at 30%
     * e.g. an income of $60,000 would have a tax of $10,000
     *
     * A. Youâ€™re an accountant and need to run this for 100 clients. Write a small program that accepts
     * income and returns the tax amount due. A single method or
     * function is fine. Acceptable languages: Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby.
